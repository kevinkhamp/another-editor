## Credits

Credits to the mini project and stackoverflow. Stackoverflow has a thread regarding Babel's plugins that are needed: [Babel Error](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56053090/babel-error-error-cannot-find-module-babel-plugin-transform-object-rest-spre). I think it is really imperative to have had this mentioned for deploying to Heroku.
